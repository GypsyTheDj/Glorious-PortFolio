Constraints on merging

As with all projects, all contributors to a pull request must have an Glorious-PortFolio CLA (Contributor License Agreement) on file before it can be merged. Here, a contributor is defined as the author of a git commit.

In this project, the following policies apply:

    Only maintainers of this module may merge pull requests.
    A person may not merge their own pull requests, nor a pull request that they have contributed code to.
    A formal review (using Github's Review feature) is not required.
    A pull request may be merged at any time after it is created.
    A person may merge code contributed by another employee of the same organization.


                     Happy Coding!!
